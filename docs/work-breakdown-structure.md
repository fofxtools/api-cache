# Work Breakdown Structure

## Core Components

### Tier 1 (Critical Path) - 40% of Development Effort

#### BaseApiClient
- Priority: Critical
- Effort: High
- Focus Areas:
  - sendRequest() - Raw request handling
  - sendCachedRequest() - Cached request handling
  - Error handling and exceptions
  - Request/response type safety
- Notes: Foundation of all API interactions

#### CacheRepository
- Priority: Critical
- Effort: High
- Focus Areas:
  - store() - Data persistence logic
  - get() - Cache retrieval
  - Data serialization/deserialization
- Notes: Core caching functionality

### Tier 2 (Essential) - 30% of Development Effort

#### ApiCacheHandler
- Priority: High
- Effort: Medium
- Focus Areas:
  - processRequest() - Main orchestration
  - Cache key generation
  - Parameter normalization
  - Response validation

#### RateLimitService
- Priority: High
- Effort: Medium
- Focus Areas:
  - Rate limit tracking
  - Throttling logic
  - Distributed rate limiting

### Tier 3 (Supporting) - 20% of Development Effort

#### CompressionService
- Priority: Medium
- Effort: Low
- Focus Areas:
  - Compression algorithms
  - Performance optimization
  - Storage efficiency

#### Exception Classes
- Priority: Medium
- Effort: Low
- Focus Areas:
  - Error hierarchies
  - Context handling
  - Error reporting

### Tier 4 (Sample Implementations) - 10% of Development Effort

#### DemoApiClient
- Priority: Low
- Effort: Low
- Focus Areas:
  - Example implementations
  - Documentation support

#### OpenAIApiClient
- Priority: Low
- Effort: Low
- Focus Areas:
  - Real-world implementation
  - Integration patterns

## Development Guidelines

### Focus Distribution
- 70% on core functionality (Tiers 1-2)
- 20% on supporting components (Tier 3)
- 10% on examples and documentation (Tier 4)

### Testing Priority
1. BaseApiClient and CacheRepository (90-100% coverage)
2. ApiCacheHandler and RateLimitService (80-90% coverage)
3. Supporting services (70-80% coverage)
4. Sample implementations (60-70% coverage)

### Documentation Requirements
1. Core Components: Extensive API docs + implementation details
2. Essential Services: Full API documentation
3. Supporting Services: Basic usage documentation
4. Sample Implementations: Example-driven documentation

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- Request/response type safety in BaseApiClient
- Cache key generation and parameter normalization in ApiCacheHandler
- Race conditions in CacheRepository
- Rate limit accuracy in RateLimitService

### Medium Risk Areas
- Compression efficiency
- Memory usage in large responses
- Cache invalidation edge cases

### Low Risk Areas
- Sample implementations
- Basic error handling
- Configuration management
